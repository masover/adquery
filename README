This is an incredibly simple ad blocker for Chromium / Google Chrome, based on jQuery and CouchDB.


==============
| Motivation |
==============

CouchDB because the HTML5 "database" API wasn't ready yet, and it was the easiest to connect to. Also because my filter rules aren't exactly secret.

Adblockers for Firefox are generally either too little (URL-based filering only), or too much (comes preset with every ad system known to man), usually both.

I don't mind ads. I realize they are how many "free" services make their money, and occasionally I see something interesting.

However, I hate ads that move. They're distracting. They slow me down, and if they're Flash-based, they slow my browser down, too. I don't mind them being interactive, or even video-based, so long as they sit still until I click on them.

It might seem that Flashblock or Noscript would be ideal, but I like scripts, interactivity, and even some Flash-based sites. Also, whitelists suck, and none of those exist for Chrome yet.

The plan is to ultimately make it simpler than Adblock for creating new rules. I'd much rather have to create rules when I see ads, than find I'm missing something cool because I blocked too zealously.

However, be aware that there is currently NO UI -- you'll have to create rules yourself in Futon or something (http://localhost:5984/_utils).

| FILTERS |
===========

Filters are simply documents that look like this:

{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "query": "#ad-frame"
}

You can pluralize "domain" or "query", and they'll take an array:

{
  "domains": ["doubleclick.net", "2mdn.net"],
  "queries": ["object", "#ad-frame"]
}

Each "query" is a jQuery expression which is applied to every page on a given domain, and all subdomains. It essentially boils down to something like this:

$('#ad-frame').remove();

This means you can use any jQuery expression to filter ads.

| EXAMPLES |
============

I don't have URL-based filters yet, but I can fake it for the worst domains. None of these domains can load flash, or any other plugin, on my browser:

{
  "domains": [
    "doubleclick.net",
    "adlegend.com",
    "2mdn.net",
    "atdmt.com"
  ],
  "query": "object"
}

Some trickier queries for a specific domain -- the kind of query I'd like to automate later:

{
  "domain": "ctrlaltdel-online.com",
  "queries": [
    "embed[id=Advertisement]",      // but this only seems to get the top one
    "object[width=160][height=600]" // any Flash of this size
  ]
}

I know exactly where this ad appears, and it annoys the hell out of me. But I kind of like the Project Wonderful ads:

{
  "domain": "questionablecontent.net",
  "query": "#side img:first"
}

PVP is nice enough to wrap everything in convenient IDs:

{
  "domain: "pvponline.com",
  "queries": [
    "#ad-leader",
    "#ad-tower",
    "#FLASH_AD"
  ]
}
